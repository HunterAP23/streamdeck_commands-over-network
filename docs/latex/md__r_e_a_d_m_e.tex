Send Stream\+Deck commands to devices over the internet.

\section*{Outline}

Inspired from the \href{https://github.com/fredemmott/streaming-remote}{\texttt{ Streaming Remote}} plugin for the Elgato Stream\+Deck, I wanted to look into sending Stream\+Deck commands from one computer to another. My first idea was to imitate the method the Streaming Remote project used, which is to use custom webhooks to access O\+BS and x\+Split remotely, but making a system for users to create their own webhooks would be really tedious.

That\textquotesingle{}s when I came across another Stream\+Deck plugin, the \href{https://github.com/abcminiuser/python-elgato-streamdeck}{\texttt{ Python Elgato Stream Deck Library}} (will be referred to as P\+E\+S\+DL from now on for brevity ), which nearly solves the issue of allowing users to create their own commands to be mapped to a Stream\+Deck button.

This project aims to extend the abilities of the P\+E\+S\+DL to work on a user\textquotesingle{}s registered devices over an internet connection.

\section*{Objectives}


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Make secure socket connection between two or more devices.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Requires handshaking when connection is made.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Send P\+E\+S\+D\+L-\/defined command name over the network to another device.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Needs security validations before sending command name.
\item Packets need to be encrypted by the sending device.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Receiving device will run that command based on the name.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Packets need to be decrypted by the receiving device.
\item Commands need to be validated prior to being run (similar to S\+QL DB validation).
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

\section*{Requirements}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Python 3 (prefer newest stable version).
\item pycrypto==2.\+6.\+1 for encryption.
\item \href{https://github.com/abcminiuser/python-elgato-streamdeck}{\texttt{ Python Elgato Stream Deck Library}} \& it\textquotesingle{}s requirements\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item hidapi==0.\+7.\+99.\+post21
\item Pillow$>$=5.\+0.\+0
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}

The Python package for P\+E\+S\+DL is already included in the requirements.\+txt file. To install the requirements, run {\ttfamily pip install -\/r requirements.\+txt}

\section*{Documentation and Commenting}

This project will use the R\+E\+A\+D\+ME for general information, while the bulk of the documentation will be auto-\/generated by Doxygen. Code commenting and documentation should follow Doxygen standards when possible, and is publicly available in the \href{https://hunterap23.github.io/streamdeck_commands-over-network/}{\texttt{ Git\+Hub Pages}}.
